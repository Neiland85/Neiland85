# ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º GDPR Compliance â€“ Cookie & Tracking Strategy

## Key Principles

- No tracking without prior consent
- Explicit opt-in for each category: essential, functional, analytics, marketing
- Consent log stored with timestamp, device info, language
- Consent can be withdrawn at any time
- Separate cookie categories with dynamic toggles

## Technical Implementation

- Consent modal on first visit (before setting non-essential cookies)
- Cookies only stored if `window.gdprConsent = { analytics: true }`
- Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel and other scripts only triggered after consent

## Example toggle logic

```js
if (window.gdprConsent?.analytics) {
  loadGoogleAnalytics();
}
```
Store gdprConsent as a signed JSON in localStorage, with timestamp and language

# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ CCPA / CPRA Compliance â€“ Data Control

## User Rights

- Right to know what data is collected
- Right to delete personal data
- Right to opt-out of the sale of personal data

## Site Obligations

- Show "Do Not Sell My Info" link
- Give access to stored data if requested
- Accept data deletion requests

## Technical Suggestions

- `ccpaUser = { id: "anon123", doNotSell: true }` stored in localStorage
- Analytics / Ad scripts disabled if `doNotSell === true`
- API endpoint: `DELETE /api/privacy/delete/:userId`
```

## Suggested UI link

```html
<a href="/do-not-sell" class="privacy-link">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>
php
Copiar
Editar
```
